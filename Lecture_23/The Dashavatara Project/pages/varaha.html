                Varaha is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a boar. 
                The story of Varaha is closely linked to the rescue of the Earth (personified as the goddess Bhudevi) 
                from the demon Hiranyaksha, who had dragged it to the bottom of the cosmic ocean. According to the myth, 
                Vishnu took the form of Varaha to dive into the ocean, defeat Hiranyaksha, and lift the Earth on his tusks, 
                restoring it to its rightful place in the universe. This avatar symbolizes the triumph of good over evil 
                and the restoration of cosmic order. The story of Varaha is detailed in various Hindu texts, including 
                the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.
