                Narasimha is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a half-man, 
                half-lion. The story of Narasimha is closely linked to the protection of his devotee Prahlada and the defeat 
                of the demon king Hiranyakashipu. According to the myth, Hiranyakashipu received a boon that made him nearly 
                invincible, but he misused his power and persecuted his son Prahlada for his devotion to Vishnu. To protect 
                Prahlada and restore dharma, Vishnu took the form of Narasimha, emerging from a pillar to kill Hiranyakashipu 
                in a manner that circumvented the boon. This avatar symbolizes the protection of devotees and the triumph of 
                good over evil. The story of Narasimha is detailed in various Hindu texts, including the Vishnu Purana and 
                the Bhagavata Purana.
