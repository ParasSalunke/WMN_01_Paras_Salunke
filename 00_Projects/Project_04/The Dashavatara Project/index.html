                <h2>Lord Vishnu</h2>
                <p>
                    Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism, is revered as
                    the preserver and protector of the universe. He forms part of the Hindu
                    trinity, known as the Trimurti, alongside Brahma (the creator) and Shiva
                    (the destroyer). While Brahma is responsible for the creation of the world,
                    and Shiva for its eventual destruction, Vishnu's role is to maintain balance,
                    order, and harmony within the cosmos, ensuring that righteousness (dharma) is
                    upheld. Vishnu is often depicted as a divine being with a serene and blue
                    complexion, symbolizing the infinite and boundless sky. He typically has four
                    arms, each holding significant items: a conch shell (shankha), representing the
                    sound of creation; a discus (chakra), symbolizing the mind and the cycle of time;
                    a mace (gada), signifying strength and power; and a lotus (padma), which represents
                    purity, beauty, and the unfolding of spiritual consciousness. Vishnu is usually
                    shown resting on the cosmic serpent Shesha, floating on the ocean of milk, with
                    his consort, Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, seated at his
                    feet. A key aspect of Vishnu's role as a preserver is his ability to incarnate
                    in different forms, known as avatars, whenever the world is threatened by chaos,
                    evil, or adharma (unrighteousness). These incarnations, collectively known as
                    the Dashavatara, include ten major avatars: Matsya (fish), Kurma (turtle), Varaha
                    (boar), Narasimha (half-man, half-lion), Vamana (dwarf), Parashurama (warrior with
                    an axe), Rama (prince of Ayodhya), Krishna (divine statesman and charioteer),
                    Buddha (the enlightened one), and Kalki (the future warrior who will appear at
                    the end of the current age). Each avatar represents a specific period in history
                    when Vishnu intervened to restore balance, protect the virtuous, and destroy evil
                    forces. Vishnu's two most popular incarnations are Rama, the hero of the epic
                    Ramayana, and Krishna, a central figure in the Mahabharata. Krishna's teachings
                    to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita emphasize the importance of duty, devotion, and
                    righteousness, making them foundational texts in Hindu philosophy.
