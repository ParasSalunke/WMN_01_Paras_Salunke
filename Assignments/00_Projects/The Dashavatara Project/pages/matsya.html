                Matsya is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a fish. 
                The story of Matsya is closely linked to the great deluge (Pralaya) and the rescue of the sacred Vedas. 
                According to the myth, Vishnu took the form of Matsya to save the sage Manu and the seven great sages (Saptarishi) 
                from the flood. Matsya guided their boat to safety and retrieved the Vedas from the demon Hayagriva, who had stolen them. 
                This avatar symbolizes salvation, protection, and the preservation of knowledge. The story of Matsya is detailed in various 
                Hindu texts, including the Matsya Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.
