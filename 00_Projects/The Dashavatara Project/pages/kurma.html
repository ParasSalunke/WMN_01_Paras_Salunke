                Kurma is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a tortoise. 
                The story of Kurma is closely linked to the churning of the ocean of milk (Samudra Manthan), a pivotal event 
                in Hindu mythology. According to the myth, the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) collaborated to churn the ocean 
                to obtain the nectar of immortality (Amrita). Vishnu took the form of Kurma to provide a stable base for Mount 
                Mandara, which was used as the churning rod. As the mountain began to sink, Kurma supported it on his back, 
                allowing the churning to continue. This avatar symbolizes support, stability, and the cosmic order. The story 
                of Kurma is detailed in various Hindu texts, including the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.
