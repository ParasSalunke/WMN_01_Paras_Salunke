                Krishna is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a divine 
                cowherd, prince, and charioteer. The story of Krishna is primarily detailed in the ancient Indian epic, 
                the Mahabharata, and the Bhagavata Purana. According to the myth, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva 
                in the Yadava clan and was raised by foster parents in the village of Gokul. He is known for his playful 
                childhood, his role as a divine lover, and his guidance to the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra war. Krishna's 
                teachings, especially those in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasize devotion, righteousness, and the path to 
                liberation. This avatar symbolizes divine love, wisdom, and the protection of dharma.
