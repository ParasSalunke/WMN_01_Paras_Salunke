                Buddha, also known as Gautama Buddha, is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu. 
                According to Hindu tradition, Vishnu incarnated as Buddha to teach compassion and non-violence and to reform 
                the religious practices of the time. Buddha's teachings emphasize the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, 
                which guide individuals towards enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara). 
                This avatar symbolizes wisdom, compassion, and the pursuit of spiritual awakening. The story of Buddha is detailed 
                in various Hindu texts, including the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana.
