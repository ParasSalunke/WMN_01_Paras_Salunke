                Parashurama is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a warrior 
                with an axe. The story of Parashurama is closely linked to his mission to rid the world of corrupt and 
                oppressive Kshatriya rulers. According to the myth, Parashurama was born to the sage Jamadagni and his wife 
                Renuka. He received an axe from Shiva after undertaking severe penance. Parashurama is known for his 
                unwavering devotion to his parents and his role in the epic Mahabharata. This avatar symbolizes the 
                destruction of evil and the protection of dharma. The story of Parashurama is detailed in various Hindu texts, 
                including the Mahabharata and the Puranas.
