                Kalki is the tenth and final avatar (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, who is yet to appear. According to Hindu eschatology, 
                Kalki will appear at the end of the current age, known as Kali Yuga, to destroy the forces of evil, restore dharma, and 
                inaugurate a new era of truth and righteousness (Satya Yuga). Kalki is often depicted as a warrior on a white horse, wielding 
                a sword. This avatar symbolizes the end of the current age of darkness and corruption and the beginning of a new cycle of time. 
                The prophecy of Kalki is detailed in various Hindu texts, including the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.
