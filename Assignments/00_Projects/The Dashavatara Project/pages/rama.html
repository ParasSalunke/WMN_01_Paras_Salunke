                Rama is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a prince and warrior. 
                The story of Rama is primarily detailed in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana. According to the myth, Rama is 
                the prince of Ayodhya who embarks on a quest to rescue his wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana. With the help 
                of his loyal brother Lakshmana, the devoted Hanuman, and an army of monkeys, Rama defeats Ravana and restores 
                dharma. This avatar symbolizes virtue, bravery, and adherence to dharma. The story of Rama is celebrated in various 
                Hindu texts, including the Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana.
