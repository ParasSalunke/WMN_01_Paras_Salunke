                Vamana is one of the ten principal avatars (Dashavatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu, depicted as a dwarf Brahmin. 
                The story of Vamana is closely linked to the demon king Bali, who had gained control over the three worlds. 
                According to the myth, Vishnu took the form of Vamana and approached Bali during a sacrificial ritual, asking 
                for as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali agreed, and Vamana then expanded to cover the entire 
                universe in two steps. For the third step, Bali offered his own head, and Vamana placed his foot on it, 
                pushing Bali to the netherworld. This avatar symbolizes humility, devotion, and the restoration of cosmic 
                order. The story of Vamana is detailed in various Hindu texts, including the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.
